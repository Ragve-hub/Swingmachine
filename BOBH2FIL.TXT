{Begin Indicator File}
{This indicator will create an ASCII file of the price data displayed on
any chart. The "Input" specifies the location and name of the file to be
exported. If you want to create multiple files with different time
frames, be sure to change the name of the file before applying the
indicator, otherwise it will erase the old file.

For ease of use, create a workspace specifically for the purpose of
exporting data. Set up a separate chart for each item or time frame that
you want to export data for.  For example, if trading the OEX, you might
want to set up separate OEX weekly, daily, and hourly charts within one
workspace.  Be sure to change the "Input" name in the indicator for each
chart. Then, every time that you open this workspace, three separate
files will be created containing the exported data.
