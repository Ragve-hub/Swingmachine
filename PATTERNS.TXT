First let me mention two names:

   1     Henry Wheeler Chase 
   2     Arthur A  Merrill

The work of Henry Wheeler Chase is buried in a pile of papers
somewhere in the files of Curt Hessler and maybe elsewhere but if so I
don't know where it is.

At one time Curt and Larry Williams were partners   During this period
they acquired (from Mr. Chases' estate) all of Henry Wheeler Chases'
remaining documentation about his method for trading.  The method was
called the Supply/Demand formula and was a very complicated method of
trading.   (Papers describing method are dated 12/48).

Part of the Supply/Demand was a method of classification of swings
using ring points. Unfortunately HWC had not organized things as well
as he might and probably some of the things he had wanted to say kind
of got lost.

Arthur A  Merrill wrote a number of wonderful books on market behavior
and a few other things.  These are a few:

    Behavior of Prices on Wall Street
    Seasonal Tendencies in Stock Prices
    Bear Market Characteristics
    Market Indicators and Growth Company Ratings
    How Do You Use the Slide Rule
    Log Scale Construction
    ABC of Log Chart Calculations
    Chess Openings Simplified

To my mind the most significant (Filtered Waves - Basic Theory) really
laid the groundwork for me to reorganize the stuff I had gotten from
Curt into what for me was something useful  To give you an idea of
when this really got started, I checked my book and found that Mr.
Merrill signed my copy of this book on 082884 even though the stuff I
got from Curt came along a lot earlier than that.

In a later work, Behavior of Prices on Wall Street, Mr. Merrill talks
about M and W waves and gives a listing of the 32 patterns he
identifies.

In classifying the M and W waves he uses 5 turning points and
consequently ends up with a lot more patterns  Also, in this book he
provided an appendix with the classification of waves laid out by
Dernell Every.  Every defined 18 patterns. 

I went through this whole mess analyzing the patterns and came to the
conclusion that the four Turning Point method provided the most
realistic answer -- partly because I could define a set of patterns
that were useful and were limited in number to ten patterns.

The following is a description of and graphic representation of the
concepts of pattern identification I gathered from the above noted
material.

As an ease to definition of patterns we will establish a couple of
conventions: 

1  Turning Point - a price at which, on both sides of this point, we
   find the prices either higher or lower than the turning point
   price.

2  BottomTP - a low price on which the low prices prices on the
   preceding and following bars are higher than the low price at
   the BTP.

3  TopTP  - a high price on each side of which the high price on
   the bars are prices lower than the high at TTP.

4  Pattern  - a series of prices which encompass:
    BTP - TTP - BTP -TTP  or
    TTP - BTP - TTP -BTP  in that order.
    
Generally we will consider a pattern to encompass 3 price ZONES.

These zones have a specific value ONLY FOR THE PATTERN which we are
examining and the value is of NO consequence   For convenience we will
call these zones L/M/H for low, middle, and high.  These zones will
define the price points at which lie the TTP's AND BTP's .

As a final identification of the patterns we describe, there will be
10 patterns which will be identified by the numeric values of  zero
(0)  through  nine (9).

In order to examine relationships between the TP's in a pattern we
assign alphabetic designations to each TP as it is encountered.  We
start enumerating with A and end with D 

The  A  point is always the earliest TP in time and the  D  point is
always the latest turningpoint in time.

I have drawn the zone lines and pattern lines using only alphabetic
characters.  However, there are associated   gif   file
which has a pictorial representation of these patterns 

Note that on charts which we present the PATTERN NUMBER (O   9)
appears at price TP's the equivalent of the letter  D  in the drawings
below.  I have drawn the patterns in pairs representing similar price
configurations in DOWN (on the left) and UP (on the right) trends.  We
can examine the relative position of the  D  point in a pattern
relative to the  A point in the pattern and establish the trend of
prices at that moment for all patterns.

The pattern group 5 to 9 have the FIRST LEG (prices going from A to B)
of the pattern going from lower to higher prices.   Conversely, the
pattern group 0 to 4 have the FIRST LEG of the pattern going from
higher to lower prices.

Maybe a look at the logic equations for the patterns will help us to
see the relative postions of prices in each pattern   I'm sure that
most everyone is familiar with the  <  and  >  symbols but just in
case:

    <   means that whatever is on the left of the < is less than
        whatever is on the right of the <  .  

    >   means that whatever is on the left of the < is greater than
        whatever is on the right of the >  . 
        
        (i e   C < A   means the price at turning point C must be less
        than the price at turning point A)

9           C > A    D > B    D > A     B > A
                  

How does all this apply to the SwingMachine, the program that performs
such classifications and then projections ? ? ? ? ?

Well the first thing the program does is to examine all swings which
exist on the set of data loaded into the program.

The program assigns a classification number (0,1,   ,9) to each
pattern it encounters and constructs an array which identifies each
Turning Point (by date/bar number) and the pattern number associated
with the 3 legs/3 turning points prior to the current point.

The pattern information is used to graph the pattern leg lines and
identification numbers on the chart that is being constructed.

Once the chart is constructed, the program again reviews all pattern
identifications in pairs of occurrences   For each such occurrence
which matches the last two pattern identification numbers on the
chart, an entry is made about the two legs which occur AFTER the given
id# pair is found  This entry consists of the slope (computed based on
the then current closing price of the data in the analyzed pattern)
and duration (in bars) of the next two (FORWARD IN TIME) legs.

The program then sorts the accumulated data based on the slope of the
first leg (or number of bars in first leg or price at end of second
leg or number of bars to second leg as desired) and "tosses" the
lowest and highest valued entries found.   Just a safety check to
keep the system from being unduly influenced by a very large or very
small swing.

As the data is accumulated, for every swing that has an initial leg
with a length of 2 bars or more, the swing is plotted as a projection
from the last TP found on the chart. 

An option exists to allow the user to select some type of "AVERAGE"
output to be plotted by the program.  The user may select either
1,2,...,999 projections to be made.

For a single projection -- all data is averaged   For a projection of
two (2) estimates, the half of the data with the lowest selected
sorting value of the first or second leg (as appropriate) is averaged
and projected and then the half of the data containing the highest
first or second leg values is averaged and projected   The same
concept is followed on higher number of projections. 
The following question from Hemi Williams is typical
of several I have received so I am posting an explanation
for all members.  Trash it if you are not interested in
SwingMachine

The program plots a series of vertical lines to the
right of the last date of the chart with some extending
above and some below a horizontal extending almost to the
right hand side of the chart.

The horizontal line is the base line.

The upgoing vertical lines are ALL the upgoing HISTORICAL
price differences in the next upgoing leg, and
the downgoing vertical lines are ALL the downgoing HISTORICAL
price differences int the next downgoing leg.

The tighter the distribution the more reliable the projections.

REMEMBER, THESE PRICE DIFFERENCES ARE DERIVED
FROM THE RATIO OF EACH LEG TO THE CLOSING PRICE
AT THE END OF THE LEG MULTIPLIED BY THE CURRENT
CLOSE so these lengths should be valid for NOW! ! !

If you believe that HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF (as you must if you use any
of the Elliot/Gann/......  time price series projection methods) then
you should accept the SwingMachine as one of the most significant
methods of projection of time and price points that is available
today.

The program can accept data in  ASCII, CSI, Computrac, and TC2000
format   The program does not care if the input is 1 minute, 1 hour,
1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, or any other time period you can
imagine.

I trust that this will answer most, if not all, of the questions which
to this point I have rather badly answered
