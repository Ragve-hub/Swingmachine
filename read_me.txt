Thank you for your access of  SwingMachine.

SwingMachine has been under development for many
years and the concentration has been on how to
extract maximum information from a data set

In this "vault" is a downloadable file titled

    SWNGPROG.ZIP
    
this file (when unzipped) contains a program that
you can execute and some instructions on what and
how to operate the program.


SwingMachine is a DOS program and must be run 
in a DOS window in the SWNGMACH directory which
should be on your root directory.

To install SWNGMACH, make a directory on root called
SWNGMACH.

Unzip the SWNGMACH.ZIP file into that directory and
READ ALL  .txt  files FIRST.  Pay particular attention
to the  README.TXT file.

PLEASE READ ALL  .TXT  FILES AND
EXAMINE THE  .GIF  FILES FIRST!
