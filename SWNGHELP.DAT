DISPSCL: DISPLAY PRICE SCALE DEFINED BY USER   (N=auto scale)

You may request system to allow user to set the high and low prices
for the top and bottom of each bar chart generated.

If the  DISPSCL  variable is set to Y, then when a chart is about
to be generated the system will inform you of the current values
and request that you use the ones specified or enter new values.

The following messages/inquiries are used:

   NEW    HIGH/LOW  VALUES ARE:  xxxxx / yyyyy
   OLD    HIGH/LOW  VALUES ARE:  aaaaa / bbbbb

   ENTER:  99999 to Use  -OLD-  HIGH/LOW  Values

           TOPVAL: VALUE TO USE FOR TOP    OF BAR GRAPH

           BOTVAL: VALUE TO USE FOR BOTTOM OF BAR GRAPH
ENDDEF

THE SAME KIND OF THING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED ON A USER
SELECTED BASIS BY USING THE  Alt +  F8  key combination
to offer the same choices during runtime.
DISPPTN: DISPLAY Ptrns xP x@1/2 P@ N=No H=h/l T=true B=Both

The system automatically determines inflection (swing) points,
defines pattern numbers based on the current and prior three
inflection point price levels, posts these pattern numbers on
the chart, and draws straight lines between between determined
inflection/turning points.

  N=No Display of Patterns      H=Display P# at High/Low
  B=Display P# at H/L & True    T=Display P# at True BAR

Pattern numbers can be posted at the High(low) point of the
swing, the True point of determination of an inflection, or
at both the High & True points, or no pattern numbers or lines
will be placed on chart.

Additionally, the system allows one to choose whether to look
for matches just for the last pattern matched when selecting
data for projection computation OR
Select data where consecutive patterns numbers match the last
TWO (2) recorded pattern numbers.  This is the default and is
generally considered to provide more reliable projection.

To select only ONE (1) match enter  1N, or 1H, or 1B, or 1T
depending on choice for display.

This is a feature that you may wish to edit the SWNGVARS.DAT
file to set your choice as the default.
ENDDEF
DISPDIV: DISPLAY N-1,2,.. PROJECTION SUMS .x =mode 0,1,2,3

The number of projections to display can vary from 1 to n,
where n is the total number of swings that were found that
matched the specification you establish.

This value is displayed on the screen as  SNW=x/YY/zzz.z
where:
x  is the "decimation/compression" value used
zzz.z  is the apparent profit for ALL swings
YY is the total number of swings.

If number of projections requested is set to 1 then only
one projection is displayed and it is the sum of all
observed projections.  A value of 2 will display a total
of 2 projections, 3 will display 3 projections . . . . .

The decimal portion of this value (1 to 8) establishes
the manner in which data is organized before any summing/
averaging takes place. The following settings are allowed

1 = order by number of days   in first leg.
2 = order by number of points in first leg  
3 = order by number of days in sum of first & second leg.
4 = order by number points  in sum of first & second leg.

Using the above values ONLY data with swings ending
on current or future bars is displayed.

To display ALL patterns for the selected number of
patterns to display, the decimal portion of this parameter
should be set to 5 through 8  (corresponding to 1 thru 4).
ENDDEF
DISPONL: DISPLAY C=CANDLE  B=BAR  L=LINE @ CLOSE  O=OPN/CLO

The user can choose to display price data in one of several
generally known display types:

If Set To:         Display Type
    C              Candlestick
    B              Open,High,Low,Close Bar
    L              Line from Close to Close
    O              Line from Open to Close to Open . . 

ENDDEF
DISPOSC: DISPLAY +=OSC/BBW -=HHLL/ANDR+ XXX.YYY (X=CH Y=OS)

Two oscillators exist which may be displayed as desired
this is done so by assigning some value such as   15.035
to this variable (or the negative of this value).

The decimal value multiplied by 1000 is the numbers in the
length for the oscillator function (equivalent to George
Angell's  LSS5Day oscillator this number is the length of
the secondary smoothing of oscillator to plot.

The Value before the decimal is the length for computation
of a "channel" based on the highest high and lowest low
over the specified number of bars.

If this value is set negative then, using the length that
is derived from the interger portion of the parameter, the
system will create:
  a.  Three Andrew's Pitchforks based on last 5 TPs.
  b.  A Donchain channel based on the highest high and
      lowest low encountered in the specified period.

ENDDEF
DISPMAX: +/-XX.YYY XX=BARS TO DISPLAY   YYY*10,000=MAX LOAD

The max bars to load (.yyy * 10,000 is really only applicable
to Computrac and Sytech type files and simply limits the     
number of bars that will be loaded from a file.  Generally
not used.

The XX portion defining the number of bars to currently
displayed should be set to your choice for your analysis. 
This is the value at the time you read a file and may be
changed later simply by defining new beginning and ending
dates to display using the  F2  key operation.

ENDDEF
EXTENDA: #BARS TO EXTEND ZONE AFTER LAST BAR (-=NO FIB LIN)

Blank space on the screen AFTER the last data point can be
established by setting this variable to whatever value is
desired.  Typically a value of 30 provides sufficient 
area for projections.

The system generates a histogram of the first two legs
of all swings that were found.  You may inhibit the display
of this histogram by making the value of this variable
negative.

ASCIEXT: EXTENSION TO USE WITH ASCII FILES Csv/Prn/Txt/Asc 

This is provided for later use.  Set it to whatever is 
your most used extension for ASCII files.
